// Package routes registers HTTP routes onto a chi.Router. Domain
// groupings (pods, workloads, network, …) live in sibling files; this
// file is the single entry point that wires them all up.

// main.go is responsible for middleware (JWT, CORS, recovery) and the
// public health endpoints. Once it has constructed the protected
// chi.Group, it hands the group to Register and forgets about routing.
